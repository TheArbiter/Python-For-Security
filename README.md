# Python-For-Security
Teacing my self Python and how to write python scripts to use in CTF Challenges. I hope to build a collection of scripts that I could end up using for future challenges

I will initially start by learning python from doing the challenges available on https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/

and then follow that by going through the challenges on http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/python-security-professionals-part-1/
